# Financial App Behavior Analysis
This is my first project whose goal is Directing Customers to Subscription Through App Behavior Analysis

Problem Statement: Prediction model is to be created to predict the customer’s behavior who will buy the product or not. The discounts would be given to the customer who is interested in using premium version of the app but they cannot afford its cost.

Dataset was loaded and analyzed, followed by preprocessing and imputation. Later, the date goes through feature selection where fewer essential features were dropped, making data manageable and more consistent

Model Selection: XG Boost performed better than other models with greater accuracy and was used for predicting customer’s behavior (2% better than best performing model)
